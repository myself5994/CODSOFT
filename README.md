Project Title: Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

Introduction:
The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their symbol (either 'X' or 'O'). This document provides a detailed explanation of the implementation of a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Setting Up the Game Environment:

The game environment is set up using the C++ programming language.
The standard input/output (I/O) library (iostream) and vectors (vector) are used to manage user input, game state, and display.

Initializing the Game Board:
A 3x3 game board is represented using a vector of characters (vector<char>).
Each cell of the game board is initialized with a space character ' ' to indicate an empty cell.

Printing the Game Board:
The printBoard function is responsible for visually representing the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe game board. It takes a reference to a vector of characters representing the board's state and prints the layout to the console, displaying numbered cells from 1 to 9. This visual representation makes it easy for players to identify and select their moves, enhancing the overall user experience of the game.

Checking for a Winner:
The checkWinner function determines if a player has won the Tic-Tac-Toe game by examining all possible winning combinations of rows, columns, and diagonals on the game board. It takes a reference to a vector of characters representing the board's state and the symbol ('X' or 'O') of the player to check for a win. By systematically analyzing each possible winning configuration, the function accurately identifies whether the specified player has achieved a winning sequence of symbols.

Checking for a Draw:
The isDraw function examines the game board to determine if it is completely filled with symbols ('X' and 'O') and if there is no winner. It iterates through each cell of the board, and if any cell remains empty, the function returns false, indicating that the game is not a draw. If all cells are filled and there is no winner, the function returns true, signaling that the game has ended in a draw. This ensures that the game can correctly identify when neither player has achieved a winning sequence and concludes the game accordingly.

Main Game Loop:
The main game loop alternates between the players ('X' and 'O') until either a winner is determined or the game ends in a draw. It prompts the current player for their move, checks for validity, updates the board, and checks for a winner or a draw before proceeding to the next turn. This process continues until the game reaches a conclusion.

Player Input and Move Validation:
The current player is prompted to enter their move by selecting a number from 1 to 9.The input is validated to ensure the selected cell is empty.

Updating the Game Board:
After validating the player's move, the game board is updated by placing the player's symbol ('X' or 'O') in the corresponding cell. This ensures that the board accurately reflects the players' moves and progresses the game forward toward determining a winner or a draw.

Winning and Draw Conditions:
After each move, the game checks for a winner using the checkWinner function.
If a winner is found, the game announces the winner and ends.
If there is no winner but the game board is full, indicating a draw, the game announces a draw and ends.

Playing Again:
After the game ends (either by a win or draw), the players are asked if they want to play again.
-If the players choose to play again, the game resets and starts a new round.
-If the players choose not to play again, the game terminates.

Conclusion:
This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. It covers the setup of the game environment, game logic, player input, win/draw conditions, and playing again functionality. The game allows two players to enjoy a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe in a console-based environment.
